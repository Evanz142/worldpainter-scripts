# worldpainter-scripts
This repository contains a collection of world painter scripts.
- smoothrivers: turns blocky rivers into smooth flowing water using the different water height options.
- adjacentWater: under construction
- fixSmallRivers: fixes one block wide rivers that dont connect diagonally by adding in orthogonal water where necessary.

Instructions are below for each script. If you need further help, have suggestions, or find a bug please message me on discord at Evmanz#1091

1. Download the script and put it into your world painter plugins folder (in world painter: Tools -> Open Plugin Directory)
2. Select the script (in world painter: Tools -> Run Script)
3. This script takes two parameters:
    1. Parameter 1 is the type of water to apply the script to. If you are using default world painter water, write "default". If you are using a custom water layer (like a custom ground cover layer) then write the **case-sensitive** name of the layer.
    2. Parameter 2 is **optional**. If you want to apply the script to only certain rivers, annotate them and then write the annotation color as the second parameter.

4. Run the script! If there is an error it should tell you how to fix it (if not, message me).
